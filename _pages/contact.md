# Abous us
The [South Green platform](http://www.southgreen.fr/) is a local network of scientists gathering Bioinformatics skills based on the Agropolis campus (Montpellier, France) that hosts research institutes such as CIRAD, IRD, INRA, SupAgro, Bioversity international as well as the CGIAR consortium.

Based on this strong local community in the field of agriculture, food, biodiversity and environment, this network of national and international scope, develops bioinformatics applications and resources dedicated to genetics and genomics of tropical and Mediterranean plants. South Green relies on the computer technical platforms of its partner institutes.
